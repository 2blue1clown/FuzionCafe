# FuzionCafe

Time available: 2 hrs

The Problem: The Fuzion café is going digital! Write an application that allows the user to order 1 or
more items from a menu and give them the bill at the end.

Solution requirements: The solution should be written in C# (preferable), JavaScript or Python. Use
up only the available time to develop. And come with unit tests.
It is your choice what type of application to deliver (mobile, web, desktop, console, other) and how
simple or complex you make it, however we are looking for quality of design and code over complex
or copious features. As an example, make sure you’ve properly implemented unit tests on the simple
core before developing the next feature. 


I used a bit of extra time because Tim said I could use 4hrs if I really wanted (sorry)
